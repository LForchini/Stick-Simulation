# Stick Simulation

This project is a simulation of sticks connected end to end.
A prominent example of this being useful is in rope and cloth simulations.

Currently the controls are as follows:

- 'L' for lock mode (default: unlocked)
- 'S' for stick-creation mode (default: node placing)
- 'U' for updating mode (default: paused)

In node placing mode, each click places a node.
To disallow movement, enter lock mode before placing the node.

In stick placing mode, click two nodes to create a stick between them.

Press 'U' to play and pause the simulation.

I'll be adding UI to show the current state in the future.
